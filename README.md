Hi,

For help, you can see your Ansible course from Kodekloud and complete your assignment



Install Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx on the local system using Ansible Roles each ansible role should be separate for each installer
 Use multiple containers in the Jenkins pipeline. Docker container should display node js and maven version with your name like Node 14.1 sarah (use Declarative Pipeline)
 Please learn about Kubernetes intro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do&t=11926s)
On completion please share the repo/artifacts/demo.
